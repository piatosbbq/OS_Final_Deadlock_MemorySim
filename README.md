Project Title: 
Simulating and Analyzing Deadlock and Memory Allocation Strategies in Operating Systems

This study focuses on understanding how deadlocks happen in operating systems and how different memory allocation methods can affect performance. By simulating real-world situations, the research looks at what causes processes to get stuck waiting for each other and how that can slow down or crash a system. It also compares memory allocation strategies like first-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit to see which ones use memory more efficiently. The goal is to learn how these concepts work in practice and how they can be improved to make systems faster and more reliable.
